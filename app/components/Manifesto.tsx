              <p className="mb-4">
                In our rush to digitize everything, we've lost something profound: the tactile experience, 
                the physical connection, and the focused attention that comes from interacting with the material world.
              </p>
              <p className="mb-4">
                Digital tools create remarkable efficiencies, but they also fragment our attention, 
                isolate us from embodied experiences, and often fail to engage our full cognitive and sensory capabilities.
              </p>
              
              <h3 className="font-display text-2xl mt-8 mb-4">The Hybrid Solution</h3>
              <p className="mb-4">
                Going Hybrid isn't about rejecting technologyâ€”it's about thoughtfully integrating it with physical interactions 
                to create experiences that are greater than the sum of their parts.
              </p>
              <p className="mb-8">
                By combining the best aspects of both worlds, we can create deeper engagement, more meaningful connections, 
                and experiences that respect our human nature while leveraging the power of digital tools.
