              <p className="mb-4">
                In our rush to digitize everything,<br /> 
                we've lost something profound:<br /> 
                the ability to capitalize socially on the human-to-human connection.<br />
                <br /> 
                Everyone seems to be fading into clicks, 
                likes and shares, 
                missing on the physical reality 
                (made of multiple layers of sensory 
                and the processing of meaning). 
                <br />
                The missing potential of the focused attention that comes from interacting with the material world. 
                
                <br />
                Posibilities are out there, but they are not being used.
              </p>
              <p className="mb-4">
                Digital tools create remarkable efficiencies, <br />
                but they also fragment our attention,<br />   
                isolate us from embodied experiences, <br />
                and often fail to engage our full cognitive and sensory capabilities.
              </p>
              
              <h3 className="font-display text-2xl mt-8 mb-4">Going Hybrid</h3>
              <p className="mb-4">
                Going Hybrid isn&apos;t about rejecting technology<br />â€”it&apos;s about thoughtfully integrating it with physical interactions <br />
                to create experiences that are greater than the sum of their parts.
              </p>
              <p className="mb-8">
                By combining the best aspects of both worlds, <br />we can create deeper engagement, more meaningful connections, <br />
                and experiences that respect our human nature while leveraging the power of digital tools.
